# Meeting-Action-Tracker
This project is a verify-first meeting action system built on the Gemini 3 API. Users paste meeting notes or add items manually, and Gemini 3 converts raw notes into structured action candidates (title, owner, due date) using strict JSON outputs, making AI results directly usable by the app rather than a chat transcript. 
The core value is reliability: the app enforces explicit rules (no duplicate titles on the same due date, done items become read-only, overdue items show a visible badge) and then proves those behaviors with an integrated validation workflow. 
In the Tests tab, a one-click test runner generates an observation log of UI actions and app state, and Gemini 3 produces a validation report that marks each requirement and test case as pass/fail/unknown with evidence. Gemini 3 also detects ambiguities or conflicts in rules/specs and can block unsafe builds instead of guessing. This turns Gemini 3 into the system’s reasoning and verification engine—powering structured extraction, rule-aware validation, and auditable test reports—rather than a generic conversational interface.
