# Meeting-Action-Tracker
This project is a verify-first meeting action system built on the Gemini 3 API. In the Tests tab, a one-click test runner generates an observation log of UI actions and app state, and Gemini 3 produces a validation report that marks each requirement and test case as pass/fail/unknown with evidence.
